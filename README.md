# AI API Reference / reference fork

This repository is a fork of **[Claws-ZH/awesome-ai-api](https://github.com/Claws-ZH/awesome-ai-api)**. The original project's
authors, licensing and contribution rules still apply. This presentation does
not claim the upstream work as an original project.

- Start with the [upstream repository](https://github.com/Claws-ZH/awesome-ai-api) for its current documentation.
- Review this fork's history before assuming it is identical to the latest upstream branch.
- Check licenses and current service behavior before using code, providers or resources.

## Existing project documentation

The documentation below is preserved from this fork's previous public revision.
Counts, service claims, badges and benchmark statements in that material are
not independently certified by this presentation pass. No upstream release,
security or availability guarantee is being added.

## What makes us different

We don't just list gateways — **we probe every one of them daily** for a real OpenAI-compatible `/v1/models` endpoint. No `200 OK on the homepage` inflation.

- 🔌 **Ground-truth API detection** — every 🔌 badge = endpoint confirmed live
- 🔍 **Transparency** — no paid placement; [raw data](./data/gateways.json) is Git-history-tracked
- 🌏 **Global** — bilingual (EN/中文), covers Western + Chinese markets
- 🛠 **Developer-first** — structured JSON, daily history snapshots, PR-editable
- 🤝 **Community-driven** — pricing & reviews by people who actually pay for these services

## 💚 Support this project

This repo is free, ad-free, and has no paid placement. If the leaderboard saved you from topping up a rug-pull, consider chipping in:

- **USDT (any EVM chain — ERC20 / BSC / Polygon / Arbitrum / Base / Optimism):**  
  `0xa5c74e7D3f0c8f1c0d7A395A6B7861Ab0A64cA7F`
- ⭐ **Star the repo** — also helps a lot; boosts us in GitHub trending.
- 📝 **Open a PR** with a gateway report — the most valuable contribution.

> 💡 **Double-check the chain before sending.** Sending from an exchange? Withdraw on **ERC20 / BSC / Polygon / Arbitrum / Base / Optimism**. **Do NOT use TRC20** (TRON) — that address doesn't exist on Tron.

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>What exactly is an "AI API gateway" or "中转站"?</b></summary>

A third-party service that exposes Claude, GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Qwen, and other frontier LLMs through a **single OpenAI-compatible HTTP API**. Most of them sit in front of the official providers and resell capacity, often at discounted prices, with friendlier payment options (WeChat/Alipay), or with extra features (rate-limit pooling, routing, logging, invoices).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How is this different from OpenRouter's /models page, helpaio.com, or apicompare.best?</b></summary>

- **OpenRouter** only lists gateways running inside OpenRouter's own routing graph. We list **every relay we can find**, including the dozens of small CN players.
- **helpaio.com** is a blog with human-written reviews. We publish **machine-verified data** (live `/v1/models` probes, engine fingerprints, uptime) alongside reviews.
- **apicompare.best** compares prices. We compare **reachability, authenticity, and stability** — cheaper doesn't help if the gateway disappears next week.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do you decide the leaderboard score?</b></summary>

We combine: reachability (HTTP 2xx), confirmed `/v1/models` endpoint, real-model count, model-keyword density on the landing page, latency, and 30-day uptime from our daily snapshots. The formula lives in [`scripts/generate_leaderboard.py`](./scripts/generate_leaderboard.py) — no black box.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Is this a paid directory? Who pays you to be listed?</b></summary>

**No one.** There is zero paid placement. Listings are either auto-discovered or PR'd by the community. The repo is MIT-licensed and ad-free. If the leaderboard helped you, consider [supporting the project](#-support-this-project).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I trust the top-ranked gateways with large amounts of money?</b></summary>

**No.** This industry sees weekly rug-pulls. A high score means a gateway is *currently* reachable, has a real API, and has been stable for 30 days — **not** that it is solvent or will still be online next month. Always top up small amounts first (≤ US$2), validate model quality, and scale slowly.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>I got scammed by a gateway. How do I report it?</b></summary>

Open a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/MackDing/awesome-ai-api/discussions) under the `Reports` category with public evidence (screenshots, transaction IDs, Telegram group links). Two independent reports + a 14-day operator response window = the gateway lands on [`data/blacklist.json`](./data/blacklist.json).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I add my gateway?</b></summary>

Add the URL to [`data/candidates.txt`](./data/candidates.txt), then (optionally) add a human-curated `name`, `region`, and `verdict` to [`data/sites.yaml`](./data/sites.yaml). Open a PR. The daily cron will pick it up.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Do you support non-OpenAI-compatible APIs (raw Anthropic, raw Gemini)?</b></summary>

We primarily probe `/v1/models` (OpenAI-compatible), because it's the lingua franca. Gateways that only expose raw Anthropic or Gemini endpoints can still be listed via `data/sites.yaml` with a `verdict: likely_relay` override and a `note` explaining the protocol.
</details>
